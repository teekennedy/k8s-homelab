      2024-12-31 Management interface is back on vlan1. Tried multiple times to access after switching to vlan 20 but no dice.
      2024-12-01 This was on vlan 1 and I switched it to vlan 2. It's supposed to get an IP over dhcp but isn't showing up in opnsense yet.

# Vlan tags should be created based on the following:
# - first 3 digits are based on the third octet of subnet, e.g. 100 for 10.69.100.128
# - last digit based on which /27 the subnet starts at (0 indexed). There are 8 /27s in a /24, so last digit would be 4 for 10.69.100.128
# Example list of subnets for 10.69.100.x: https://www.calculator.net/ip-subnet-calculator.html?cclass=any&csubnet=27&cip=10.69.100.0&ctype=ipv4&x=Calculate
